# Examples

This folder has example artwork and template files for the **latest in-development** project code.
These may not work with older versions of the project, possibly not even the latest release.

You should take a look at the example files within the git tree at the version you want, which can
be found linked in the release page, or in the git repository at the tag of that version.
