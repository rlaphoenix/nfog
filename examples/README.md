# Examples

This folder has example artwork and template files for the **latest in-development** project code.
These may not work older versions of the project, possibly not even the latest release.

The example files you should be using is the example files as they were when the version was
released. The [Latest Release](https://github.com/rlaphoenix/releases/latest) page will have
a link to the example folder when it was released, so you can take a look at them.
